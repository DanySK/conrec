# Conrec
Conrec is a straightforward method of contouring surfaces. For further information about how it works see [Conrec paper](http://paulbourke.net/papers/conrec/).

This project only aims to make Conrec algorithm available in other (more complex) projects, and it only contains the source files downloadable from the link above.
